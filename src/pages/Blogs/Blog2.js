        COVID-19 has brought in a big social revolution, bringing changes in
        every aspect of our lives. The workplace also saw drastic shifts in
        culture and pre-COVID norms, diminishing boundaries between work and
        home. The pandemic challenged supply chains while businesses faced
        reduced revenue and market share. Such disruptions asked for increased
        efficiency and a cost-effective operational model in the entire value
        chain of an organization—including the human capital. While the
        technology helped businesses adopt remote working as mainstream culture,
        the continued scarcity of skilled workforce poses a severe risk to the
        post-COVID recovery phase. As 2020 proved to be a tipping point for
        work, workplace, and workforce, organizations are looking to survive and
        thrive in the new normal. The pandemic forced industries to rethink,
        re-envision, reimagine and retransform the fundamentals of human
        capital. In the future, the challenges created by COVID could enable
        workers to organize their working lives as they see fit. It'll help
        businesses become competitive, reduce the governmental challenges of
        high unemployment levels and economic hardship, and sign up for a new
        social contract that sets the road map for achieving that.

        Priorities Changed
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" className="my-3 mx-5 text-justify">
        Digital Transformation might be the buzzword, but acquiring and
        retaining top talents have always been at the core of an efficient
        workforce. Workers no longer operate in siloes, but the entire ecosystem
        of employees, contractors, and contingent workers work in tandem to
        support business operations. Before the outbreak, most of the businesses
        had fully operational offices, with enterprises having offices
        worldwide. Strict regulations around the data access required the work
        to be carried out strictly at offices—either onsite or off-site. Most
        organizations emphasized cross-skilling and up-skilling their workforce
        as part of strategic priority to bring agility and operational
        efficiency. However, since the outbreak of COVID, companies are
        envisioning adaptability and elasticity in their workforce. As per a
        survey by LinkedIn, "Facing unprecedented uncertainty and volatility,
        companies will move away from static jobs in siloed departments and
        toward project-based cross-functional work, where employees will shift
        to new projects as business needs change. The survey also predicts
        virtual hiring to pick up exponentially. It states, "Candidates for
        entry-level positions may experience a completely virtual hiring
        process, not setting foot in the office until they're onboarded.
        Executive candidates, on the other hand, will continue to receive a more
        bespoke process with numerous onsite visits and virtual one-on-ones
        helping out fresh recruits to adapt to the culture." As the workplaces
        reimagined, the talent market is virtually the entire world, giving a
        better chance to tap the best resource. Human capital is now
        transforming to become highly agile, adaptable, and resilient.

        Talent Scarcity
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" className="my-3 mx-5 text-justify">
        Technology is evolving, and so is the expectation from fresh graduates.
        As per an Accenture report, "Over the next decade, the 14 G20 countries
        in our analysis could miss out on as much as US$11.5 trillion of
        cumulative growth promised by intelligent technologies, if they can't
        meet future skills demand. That equates to forgoing more than an entire
        percentage point from their annual average GDP growth rate every year."
        Beyond such a massive economic impact, more significant risks are
        unemployment and income disparity. As the labor market is not uniformly
        distributed, this impact will differ by country and industry. Another
        extensive report by agency Korn Ferry suggests that by 2030, over 85
        million jobs could go unfilled due to the lack of adequate skilled
        people to take them. The impact of the talent crunch is so massive that
        the continued predominance of industry leaders is in question. An
        obvious solution is to bring more skilled graduates to emerging
        technologies like AI, cloud, and IoT. But, the question is, "Are these
        fresh graduates or entry-level workers worth investment?" A recent
        survey by AJobThing mentions that fresh graduates possessing internships
        are 70% more likely to be hired as full-time employees with a company,
        and 66% of employers think that relevant work experience is the most
        critical factor in their hiring decision."

        Aging Workforce
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" className="my-3 mx-5 text-justify">
        As per a global estimate, it is projected that the workers aged between
        50 and 64 will increase by 15-30% by 2030. As the industry faces
        pressing challenges around talent scarcity, an un-proportionate rise of
        an 'experienced' workforce will be threatening an ideal workforce mix
        for any organization. This demographic shift also attracts negative
        sentiments due to ever-increasing healthcare costs. Strategically
        tapping the 'experienced' pool will help alleviate the talent shortfall
        concerns and provide impetus to high-demand qualities like social
        skills, hands-on experience, maturity, emotional stability, and better
        decision-making. Organizations should try to achieve a healthy
        combination of 'experienced' and a young workforce via innovative job
        and talent operational models to leverage a future-ready, experienced
        workforce. Job Model: A job should focus on the goal rather than the
        suitable resource mapping. Hiring managers should envision what they
        want to achieve as part of a job and then augment it with the proper
        sourcing. For example, a typical job can also be fulfilled by a
        combination of experienced, young, or fresh graduates to bring in
        micro-level diversity and efficiency. Talent Model: Talent should not be
        limited to traditional markets but open to new innovative models to
        attract the best talents. For example, the gig economy brings
        flexibility and mobility to the workplace but is often hampered by few
        structural drawbacks. While experienced professionals can hit the ground
        running with hardly any training, they often bring strong leadership
        skills to influence the young workforce. However, hiring a new talent
        who has entry-level experience can result in enormous advantages for
        your business — inculcating a culture of learning and innovative ways of
        thinking. When choosing between hiring experienced and inexperienced
        employees, an out-of-box approach might be to select a combination of
        both for the same job rather than choosing either of them.

        Learning while Working
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" className="my-3 mx-5 text-justify">
        Macro trends like digital transformation, COVID impact, decreasing
        shelf-life of traditional skills, and exponential rise of niche
        skillsets are challenging organizations to catch up as they try to hire,
        develop and retain their people. The primary focus for organizations is
        to identify, assess, and close skills gaps. Unfortunately, dedicated L&D
        programs are no longer a viable option as there is increased pressure to
        reduce L&D budgets to protect cash flow during the pandemic. Up-skilling
        and reskilling while working will be the way how talent will be nurtured
        in the future. With employees working remotely, learning should happen
        as part of the work and be augmented with technology and mentorship from
        seniors or experienced colleagues.

        Remote Workforce
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" className="my-3 mx-5 text-justify">
        COVID-19 is a trend accelerator. The crisis has turbocharged niche
        trends around digital adoption in workplace flexibility. One of the most
        incredible adoptions has occurred with the rise of flexible work
        practices, including remote hiring. Several surveys have shown that
        leaders are generally willing to allow remote working to continue after
        the crisis. Gartner finds that 80% of company leaders plan their
        employees to work remotely for at least part of the time post-pandemic,
        and 47% of leaders will allow employees to work from home permanently.
        Another survey by Enterprise Technology Research finds, "Global CIOs
        expect remote work to increase to 34.4% after the pandemic—double
        pre-pandemic levels but half of the pandemic peak." However, contrary to
        expectations, remote workers have increased productivity—between 15% and
        45%—than their in-office colleagues. Significant cost savings is also
        one of the benefits for a remote workforce. IBM saved around $50 million
        per year in real estate costs, McKesson saved $2 million, and Sun
        Microsystems saved almost $68 million a year due to remote workers not
        needing office space. (Global Workplace Analytics)

        Conclusion
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" className="mt-3 mb-3 mx-5 text-justify">
        External forces like COVID are redefining the workforce. There are
        unique and sustained challenges to be faced as business leaders grapple
        with demographic and social changes, disruptive technologies, and
        innovative breakthroughs. Companies can no longer afford to hold onto
        outdated hiring approaches and skillsets. Organizations need to reshape
        the workforce culture and create innovative skill ecosystems that build
        an engaged, enabled, and agile workforce. In the PwC survey, "37% of
        respondents said they were excited and see a world full of
        possibilities. But 18% said they were worried and nervous about what the
        future holds." Those who can create and sustain the right crew, with the
        right skillsets, at the right time will eventually gain from all the
        possibilities that lie ahead without getting overwhelmed by its
        challenges. There is a need for a Next-Gen platform that offers quick
        hiring of skilled talent while high turnover and peace of mind to hiring
        managers. Adopting a comprehensive and flexible platform can provide a
        tangible, meaningful impact on an organization's human capital.
